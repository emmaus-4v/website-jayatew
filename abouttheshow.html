                <p> There is a lot to talk about the show and every season. For example every season has something special happening, but more about that in <a href="summary.html"> summaries</a>.  </p>
                <p> In the first season we all get to meet the main characters. The first shot was that in the iconic tea and coffee shop: Central Park. The first episode aired for the first time in America, but because it wasn't a hit with the public the rest of the show almost didn't air. The website already mentioned that the show discusses a lot of serieus topics, one of these topics is pregnancy. In the show all of the female main characters get childeren and all of the three women have irregular pregnancy. So was Phoebe the surrogate mother of a triplet. For her brother and his wife. Rachel got pregnant after an one nightstand. Besides she was unmarried when she had her child. And last Monica was unable to get pregnant, so she adopted a child. <br> Another serieus topic discussed in the show is being a lesbien. The show already had lesbien characters in the first season and even in the first episode it was already mentioned. </p>

                <p> The show was made by David Crane and Martha Kauffman. They began developing the show under the name 'insomnia caf√©', between november and december 1993. They presented the idea to Kevin S. Bright and he liked it but wanted to rename the show. So has had the show many names but ended up by Friends. <br> The show was produced by Kevin S. Bright, David Crane and Martha Kauffman.  </p>
