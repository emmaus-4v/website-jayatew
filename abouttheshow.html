                <p> There is al lot to talk about the show and every season. For example every season has something special helping, but more about that in <a href="summary.html"> summaries</a>.  </p>
                <p> In the first season we all get to meet the main characters. The first shot was that in the iconic tea and coffee shop: Central Perk. The first episode aired for the first time in America, but because it wasn't a hit with the public the rest of the show almost didn't air. The website alredy menshoined that the show discusses a lot of serieus topics, one of these topics is pregnancy. In the show all of the female main characters get childeren and all of the three women have irregular pregenancy. So was Phoebe the surragte mother of a triplet. For her brother and his wife. Rachel got pregnant after an one nightstand. Besides she was unmarried when she had her child. And last Monica was unable to get pregnant, so she addoped a child. <br> Another serieus topic discused in the show is being a lesbien. The show alrady had lesbien characters in the first season and even in the first episode it was already menshoined.   </p>
